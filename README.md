# TheSCPFoundationCRUD-HTML
My SCP Foundation CRUD but just the **Front-End** part for the subject *Markup Language*.

This is just the Front-End of my CRUD so the Back-End part (made originally in JSP and TSQL) has been deleted.
All the pages are linked in the logical way (if you click in *Log In* you can access to the login page or if you place username and password you will access to the editor page even if the password or the username are wrong).

## SEARCH AND ORDER
To Search something, click on the "**Search...**" bar and then press Enter or type whatever you want and press enter. I've added by default some search with their correspondent result and how it has to be shown.
The order option (*below the Search bar*), logically **doesn't work** because it was made with JSP.
Search and Order option are put into Reader and Editor pages.

## LOGIN AND SIGNUP
To Log In and Sign Up, just *place whatever is required* in each field.
After that, you will access to the *Editor page* logged in as ***User1***, no matter whatever you type in the fields.

## RETURN BACK
To return back in each page, you have to click on the SCP Logo (to return to index) or, to click to Log Out (to return to login in Editor pages). Also, whenever you search, you have the option *Return* to come back to the Reader or Editor page, depending on the search. Also you can use the Browser's Arrow to move into pages.
